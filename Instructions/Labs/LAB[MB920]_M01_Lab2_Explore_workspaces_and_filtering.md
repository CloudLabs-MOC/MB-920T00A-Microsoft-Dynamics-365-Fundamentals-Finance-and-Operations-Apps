## Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

## Lab 2 - Explore workspaces and filtering

## Objectives

Many built-in workspaces are available to you when you first sign in to Finance and Operations. You can also create your own workspace with content focused on a need you may have. Workspaces are one of the many features of Dynamics 365, but you should also be aware that filtering is the way to really get to the specific items you may be looking for. You must create a new personalized workspace and use filtering to identify different items you need.
