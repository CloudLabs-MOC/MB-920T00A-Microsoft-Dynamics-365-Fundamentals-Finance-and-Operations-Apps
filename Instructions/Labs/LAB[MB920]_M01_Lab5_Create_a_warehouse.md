# Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management

## Lab 5 - Create a warehouse

## Objectives
The Warehouse management system in Supply Chain Management gives you flexible ways to define your warehouse layout to meet changing needs, so that you can achieve optimal warehouse efficiency.

- You can establish high-priority and low-priority storage areas for optimum placement of goods.
- You can divide your warehouse into zones to accommodate various storage needs, such as temperature requirements, or various turnover rates for items.
- You can specify warehouse locations on any level (for example, site, warehouse, aisle, rack, shelf, and bin position).
- You can group locations by using physical capacity constraint settings.
- You can control how items are stored and picked, based on query-defined rules.

To use warehouse management in Supply Chain Management, you must create a warehouse and enable it for more advanced or specialized warehouse management activities.
